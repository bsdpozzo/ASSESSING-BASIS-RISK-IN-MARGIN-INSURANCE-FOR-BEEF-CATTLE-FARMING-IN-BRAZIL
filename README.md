**ASSESSING BASIS RISK IN MARGIN INSURANCE FOR BEEF CATTLE FARMING IN BRAZIL**

## Author

## Overview
This repository aims to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analyses conducted in the study, which evaluates basis risk in margin insurance for beef cattle farming in Brazil. The analysis relies on spot and futures price data, deflated series, and stochastic simulations at both federal and state levels.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains the datasets used in the analysis:
  - `data_prices.xlsx`: Spot market price data from CEPEA, used to represent physical cattle and corn prices, futures price data for live cattle and corn obtained from the Brazilian stock exchange (B3), collected via Investing.com, and Federal-level feeder cattle price data obtained from Agrolink.
  - `IGP-DI.xlsx`: IGP-DI price index used to deflate all nominal price series.

- `scripts/`  
  Contains the R scripts used in the analysis:
  - `risco_base_1.R`: Basis risk simulations using federal-level price series.
  - `risco_base_2.R`: Basis risk simulations using state-level price series.

- `outputs/`  
  Stores the tables and figures generated by the scripts (if applicable).

## Data Sources
The price series used in this study originate from the following sources:
- **CEPEA (Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics)**: Spot market prices for cattle in Brazil.
- **B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange)**: Futures prices for live cattle, collected via Investing.com.
- **Agrolink**: Federal-level feeder cattle (boi magro) price series.
- **FGV (Getulio Vargas Foundation)**: IGP-DI price index used for deflation.

## Methodological Notes
- All price series are deflated using the IGP-DI index prior to the simulations.
- Spot and futures prices are combined to construct margin and basis risk measures.
- The scripts are designed to be executed independently according to the level of price aggregation (federal or state).
- The methodological framework follows the international literature on basis risk and margin insurance, adapted to the Brazilian beef cattle sector.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results, run the scripts according to the analysis of interest:

1. `risco_base_1.R` — federal-level price-based simulations  
2. `risco_base_2.R` — state-level price-based simulations  

Ensure that all required R packages are installed and that the data files are correctly placed in the `data/` directory.
